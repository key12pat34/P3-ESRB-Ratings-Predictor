# GT-FinalProject

https://gtfinalproject.herokuapp.com/


## Project Description/ Outline:
* We plan to use a classification model to try to predict accurately the ESRB ratings for games that have recently come out and are not listed on this data set. We plan to use Python/Pandas to clean the data we got (https://www.kaggle.com/imohtn/video-games-rating-by-esrb), load it into an AWS s3 bucket, and then start our training on the model. 

* Training a machine on ESRB ratings for PS4 and Xbox One Games to accurately predict ESRB ratings based off of the identified content of a title. We want the machine to be able to accurately predict the rating of a game based on the following elements: Alcohol_Referencem Animated_Blood, Blood, BloodandGore, Cartoon_Violence, Crude_Humor, DrugRe_ference, Fantasy_Violence, Intense_Violence, Language, Lyrics, Mature_Humor, Mild_Blood, MildCartoonViolence, MildFantasyViolence, Mild_Language, Mild_Lyrics, MildSuggestiveThemes, Mild_Violence, No_Descriptors, Nudity, Partial_Nudity, Sexual_Content, Sexual_Themes, Simulated_Gambling, Strong_Language, StrongSexualContent, Suggestive_Themes, UseofAlcohol, UseofDrugsandAlcohol, Violence

## Research Questions to Answer:
* How accurate is our model at predicting the ESRB for newer video games that aren’t in our original dataset?
* What is the reason for any inaccuracy in the predictions?
* Can this model be applied to games for other platforms that aren’t present in our original dataset?
